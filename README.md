## Overview
### Description
This app will be geared towards students. It will allow users to sync their phone’s calendar, add events/tasks within the app, and input their class schedules with the purpose of showing them the chunks of free time they will have during the day. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Productivity
- **Mobile:** This app’s functionality would be limited to mobile only. This is because we want to encompass the “on the go” lifestyle. 
- **Story:** Analyzes users tasks for the day and tells users the time periods during the day when they will have downtime (time they can use to be productive or do leisurely activities).
- **Market:** Mainly marketed towards high school and college students.
- **Habit:** This app should be used daily for help with increased productivity.
- **Scope:** First we would start with marketing to college students and would want to expand to being a productivity app for all. We would also want to expand into the health arena as well by tracking sleep and eating habits within the app as well.

## Product Spec

### 2. Screen Archetypes

   * After logging in, this is the first screen users will see. It will default to a daily calendar view but they can choose a weekly or monthly view.
* Slack Time Screen - Shows users a graphical view of how their time for the day is being used
   * After tapping the corresponding icon in the menu bar, users will see a pie chart depicting all their tasks for the day. This screen will also recommend how many hours of sleep the user should plan to add into their day.
* Add task/Add Event Screen
   * After tapping the corresponding icon in the menu bar, users will be able to either add an event or add a task to their calendar within the app.

This will help with calculating how much free time the user really will have during their day.
